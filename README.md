It is a website to detect the plagiarism in the academic projects which can stop plagiarism and copying of students projects. Algorithm used is Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA) and NLP processing in python. It is a storage system for all projects, with students database, guide database which can be used by any college.
Plagiarism by students, professors or researcher is considered academic fraud. Plagiarism is defined in multiple ways like copying others original work without acknowledging the author or source. Original work is code, formulas, ideas, research, strategies, writing or other form. 
Punishment for plagiarism consists of suspension to termination along with loss of credibility. Therefore, detecting plagiarism is essential.
In this project we are going to develop a system for plagiarism detection in which whenever a student submits an project title,abstract it detects that it is plagiarized or not by comparing with other students project.
